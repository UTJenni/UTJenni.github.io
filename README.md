# **Research Project: Gender, Antidepressant Use, and Relationship Outcomes**
### How Does Gender and Antidepressant Use Impact Relationships, Sex, and Commitment?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Objectives**

The goal of this project is to explore how gender and antidepressant use influence 
relationship satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, and commitment. These factors are 
critical markers of relational health, yet their intersections remain underexplored.

### **Why This Matters**

**Relational Health:** Relationship satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, and commitment are foundational to relational well-being.

**Impact of Antidepressants:** Previous studies show antidepressants can affect sexual and relationship satisfaction(Baldwin & Foong, 2018; Meyer 2007).

**Gender Differences:** Research indicates that antidepressants may impact genders differently (Keers & Aitchison, 2010).

**Research Gap:** Little is known about the intersection of gender and antidepressant use on these relational factors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Approach**

**Source:** National Couplesâ€™ Health and Time Study (NCHTS), 2020â€“2021 (ICPSR Study 38417) (Dush et al., 2024).
**Sample Size:** 3,508 U.S. adults.
**Demographics:**  
  - **Gender:** 49% Men, 47% Women, 4% Other.
  - **Antidepressant Use:** 19% reported taking antidepressants.
  - **Sexual Orientation:** 58% identified as heterosexual.

### **Measures**

Three relational outcomes were examined:
1. **Relationship Satisfaction**
  - "Please indicate the level of happiness, all things considered, in your relationship?" *(1 = Extremely Unhappy, 6 = Extremely Happy)*
  - "I have a warm and comfortable relationship with my spouse/partner?" *(1 = Not at all true, 6 = Completely True)*
  - "How rewarding is your relationship with your spouse/partner?" *(1 = Not at all rewarding, 6 = Completely Rewarding)*
  - "In general, how satisfied are you with your relationship?" *(1 = Not at all satisfied, 6 = Completely Satisfied)*

2.  **Sexual Satisfaction**
  - "How satisfied are you with your sexual relationship with your partner?" *(1 = Not at All Satisfied, 6 = Completely Satisfied)*

3.  **Commitment**
  - "How committed are you to your relationship?" *(1 = Not at All Commited, 6 = Completely Commited)*

### **Analytic Approach**

Using ANOVA and regression analyses, I assessed differences in relationship satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, 
and commitment based on gender and antidepressant use, accounting for key demographic factors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Findings**

The main takeaways are clear. Interpretation is accurate and careful. Results are supplemented with graphs.

### **Key Results**

Men on antidepressants were less sexually satisfied and less committed than women on antidepressants.

Women, whether on antidepressants or not, had high levels of satisfaction and commitment.

1.  **Relationship Satisfaction**
    -   Men on antidepressants reported lower relationship satisfaction compared to men not on antidepressants (*p* = .049).
    -   Womenâ€™s relationship satisfaction was consistently high, regardless of antidepressant use.

2.  **Sexual Satisfaction**
    -   Women on antidepressants reported higher sexual satisfaction than men on antidepressants (*p* \< .0001).
    -   Men on antidepressants had lower sexual satisfaction compared to men not on antidepressants (*p* = .0002).

3.  **Commitment**
    -   Women on antidepressants were more committed than men on antidepressants (*p* \< .001).
    -   Men on antidepressants were less committed than men not on antidepressants (*p* \< .001).

## **Impact**

Explain why this research is important, who it might benefit, 
and how people in the applied setting might be able to use your findings.
Claims are based on the results and the nature of the data, and not overly generalized.

### **Why These Findings Matter:**

1.  **Sexual Dysfunction:** Results for sexual satisfaction complements research that a larger percentage of men experience sexual dysfunction than women. (Higgins, et al., 2010)
2.  **Emotional Dysfunction:** Results for relationship satisfaction and
commitment follows previous findings that men experience more
emotional blunting than women which may contribute to reduced
engagement or connection in relationships. (Goodwin, et al. 2017)
3.  **Protective Factors:** Antidepressant use did not significantly affect
womenâ€™s scores. Research indicates that women self-report low
perceived distress with both sexual dysfunction and emotional blunting,
raising questions about potential gender differences / protective factors
in navigating these side effects. (Lorenz, et al., 2019; Goodwin, et al., 2017)

### **Practical Applications:**

-   Clinicians could use these findings to guide conversations with patients about the relational side effects of antidepressants, especially for men.
-   Couples therapy could address challenges like emotional blunting and sexual dysfunction to mitigate relational impacts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Future Directions**

1.  **Antidepressant Factors:** Investigate the role of specific antidepressant types, dosages, and duration of use in relational outcomes.
2.  **Gender and Sexual Identity:** Collect more data on diverse gender identities and sexual orientations to understand their unique experiences.
3.  **Physical and Emotional Dysfunction:** Explore how sexual dysfunction and emotional blunting interact with relationship satisfaction and commitment.
4.  **Relationship Context:** Examine variables like relationship duration, partner involvement, and the role of sexual and emotional dynamics (e.g., single vs. partnered sex, therapy).
5.  **Longitudinal Studies:** Conduct daily diary or dyadic studies to capture the evolution of relational dynamics over time.

Must attribute credits and hyperlink to the original dataset, hyperlink to your analytic codes 
(e.g., your md or rmd). The overall presentation is digestible, professional, and concise. 
No erroneous links or photos. The language is accessible and does not require expertise in psychology to understand. 
No jargon is used (e.g., IV, DV, or moderator). 
The only exception is mentioning the specific analysis like ANOVA or regression, 
but your focus should be the purpose of the analysis (e.g., 
I tested the relationship between A and B while taking into account C and D by using multiple regression) 
rather than flexing those terms as fancy jargon.
