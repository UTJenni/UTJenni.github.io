# **Research Project: Gender, Antidepressant Use, and Relationship Outcomes**

How Does Gender and Antidepressant Use Impact Relationships, Sex, and Commitment?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Objectives**

The project goal/purpose is clearly defined. The research question is clearly stated. 
It is clear to see what the gap is or why the question is meaningful.

The goal of this project is to explore how gender and antidepressant use influence 
relationship satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, and commitment. These factors are 
critical markers of relational health, yet their intersections remain underexplored.

### **Why This Matters:**

-   **Relational Health:** Relationship satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, and commitment are foundational to relational well-being.\
-   **Impact of Antidepressants:** Previous studies show antidepressants can affect sexual and relationship satisfaction (Baldwin & Foong, 2018; Meyer, 2007).\
-   **Gender Differences:** Research indicates that antidepressants may impact genders differently (Keers & Aitchison, 2010).\
-   **Research Gap:** Little is known about the intersection of gender and antidepressant use on these relational factors..

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Approach**

Basic description of the data: what dataset is used, sample size, 
how the data is collected in the original study. 
Clearly state how the analytic method and variables used match the question.

-   **Source:** National Couples’ Health and Time Study (NCHTS), 2020–2021 (ICPSR Study 38417; Dush et al., 2024).\
-   **Sample Size:** 3,508 U.S. adults.\
-   **Demographics:**
    -   **Gender:** 49% Men, 47% Women, 4% Other.\
    -   **Antidepressant Use:** 19% reported taking antidepressants.\
    -   **Sexual Orientation:** 58% identified as heterosexual.

### **Measures**

Three relational outcomes were examined:\
1. **Relationship Satisfaction**\
  - "Please indicate the level of happiness, all things considered, in your relationship?" *(1 = Extremely Unhappy, 6 = Extremely Happy)*\
  - "I have a warm and comfortable relationship with my spouse/partner?" *(1 = Not at all true, 6 = Completely True)*\
  - "How rewarding is your relationship with your spouse/partner?" *(1 = Not at all rewarding, 6 = Completely Rewarding)*\
  - "In general, how satisfied are you with your relationship?" *(1 = Not at all satisfied, 6 = Completely Satisfied)*\

2.  **Sexual Satisfaction**\
  - "How satisfied are you with your sexual relationship with your partner?" *(1 = Not at All Satisfied, 6 = Completely Satisfied)*

3.  **Commitment**\
  - "How committed are you to your relationship?" *(1 = Not at All Commited, 6 = Completely Commited)*

### **Analytic Approach**

Using ANOVA and regression analyses, I assessed differences in relationship satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, 
and commitment based on gender and antidepressant use, accounting for key demographic factors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Findings**

The main takeaways are clear. Interpretation is accurate and careful. Results are supplemented with graphs.


### **Key Results**

Men on antidepressants were less sexually satisfied and less committed than women on antidepressants.

Women, whether on antidepressants or not, had high levels of satisfaction and commitment.

1.  **Relationship Satisfaction**
    -   Men on antidepressants reported lower relationship satisfaction compared to men not on antidepressants (*p* = .049).\
    -   Women’s relationship satisfaction was consistently high, regardless of antidepressant use.
2.  **Sexual Satisfaction**
    -   Women on antidepressants reported higher sexual satisfaction than men on antidepressants (*p* \< .0001).\
    -   Men on antidepressants had lower sexual satisfaction compared to men not on antidepressants (*p* = .0002).
3.  **Commitment**
    -   Women on antidepressants were more committed than men on antidepressants (*p* \< .001).\
    -   Men on antidepressants were less committed than men not on antidepressants (*p* \< .001).
